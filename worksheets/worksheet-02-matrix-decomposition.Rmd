<!-- ## Directions -->

<!-- Complete the problems on this worksheet with your break out group. You may want to refer to the  [Introduction to Matrix Algebra Course Notes](https://zief0002.github.io/epsy-8264/misc/01-introduction-to-matrix-algebra.html) and the sections you read in the Fox book. -->

<!-- You will likely be learning (or re-encountering) many new mathematical terms. It is a good idea to note and define all the vocabulary/terms that you encounter as you work through Unit 1. You may want to do this individually or create a shared document that you can all contribute to. -->

## Problems

Write out the system of equations based on the given matrices. Use conventional algebra to solve these equation. (Do not use matrix algebra to compute an inverse!)

$$
\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0\\1 & 3\end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix}b_1\\b_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}8 \\7\end{bmatrix}
$$
