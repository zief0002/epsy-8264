<!-- ## Directions -->

<!-- Complete the problems on this worksheet with your break out group. You may want to refer to the  [Introduction to Matrix Algebra Course Notes](https://zief0002.github.io/epsy-8264/misc/01-introduction-to-matrix-algebra.html) and the sections you read in the Fox book. -->

<!-- You will likely be learning (or re-encountering) many new mathematical terms. It is a good idea to note and define all the vocabulary/terms that you encounter as you work through Unit 1. You may want to do this individually or create a shared document that you can all contribute to. -->

## Problems

1. Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvector of **A** to create the **P** and **D** matrices of the eigendecomposition. Do this by hand and also use R to verify your work.

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}2 & 3\\3 & 2\end{bmatrix} 
$$

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

2. Once you have computed **P**, use R to show that:

    - $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{P}^{-1}$
    - The trace of **A** is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues. 
    - **P** is an orthogonal matrix. (Note: **P** is only orthogonal when **A** is a symmetric matrix.)



<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

3. Carry out LU decomposition on **A** by hand. Check your work using R.
