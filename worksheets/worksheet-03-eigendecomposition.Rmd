<!-- ## Directions -->

<!-- Complete the problems on this worksheet with your break out group. You may want to refer to the  [Introduction to Matrix Algebra Course Notes](https://zief0002.github.io/epsy-8264/misc/01-introduction-to-matrix-algebra.html) and the sections you read in the Fox book. -->

<!-- You will likely be learning (or re-encountering) many new mathematical terms. It is a good idea to note and define all the vocabulary/terms that you encounter as you work through Unit 1. You may want to do this individually or create a shared document that you can all contribute to. -->

## Problems

Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvector of **A** to create the **P** and **D** matrices of the eigendecomposition. Do this by hand and also use R to verify your work.

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}2 & -1\\3 & -2\end{bmatrix} 
$$

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Once you have computed **P**, use R to show that: (1) $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{P}^{-1}$; and (2) **P** is an orthogonal matrix.
