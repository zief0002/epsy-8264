#### Unit 13: Piecewise Regression Models 

In this unit we will learn about piecewise models as a method for fitting local models. The notes for this unit are available as an HTML file at:

- [Piecewise Regression](http://www.datadreaming.org/files/epsy-8264/13-piecewise-regression.html) [Class Notes]

In addition to the class notes and what we cover in class, there many other resources for learning about piecewise models. Here are some resources that may be helpful in that endeavor:

- Berk, R. (2016). Splines, smoothers, and kernels.  *Statistical learning from a regression perspective* (2nd ed., pp. 55&ndash;127). New York: Springer.
- Fox, J. (2016). Nonlinear regression. *Applied regression analysis and generalized linear models* (3rd ed., pp.502&ndash;527). Thosand Oaks, CA: Sage.
- James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2013). Moving beyond linearity. *[An introduction to statistical learning: with applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)* (pp. 265&ndash;301). New York: Springer.
- [Statistical Learning MOOC](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) taught by Hastie and Tibshirani
